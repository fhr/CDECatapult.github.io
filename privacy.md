## Your privacy - how cookies are used by Connected Digital Economy Catapult
 
Connected Digital Economy Catapult uses small amounts of data stored on your
computer called 'cookies' to collect information about how visitors
use the website. You can control what cookies, if any, are stored on
your computer. Find out more about cookies below.

## What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data sent to your computer or mobile
phone from a website. It often includes a unique identifier and is
stored on your device's hard drive. Connected Digital Economy Catapult
doesn't use cookies to collect information that can be used to
identify you.
 
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it. Your browser is the computer program you use to
access the internet. By default, your browser will only allow a
website to access the cookies it's already sent to you, and not the
cookies sent to you by any other website. This is to protect your
privacy.

## Types of cookies

There are effectively four different variants of cookies that websites
create:

 - Session cookies – These types of cookies are only valid when the
 user browses a site and are expired when the user leaves a
 website. Session cookies are used to remember if a user has logged
 into a website for example.
 - Persistent cookies – Persistent cookies are not cleared when a user
 closes their browser. They are used to remember if the user has
 visited the site before, whether they ticked a 'remember me' type
 checkbox when logging into the site or where the user visited the
 website from. These types of cookies generally have a fixed
 time-frame before expiring, for example a year.
 - First party cookies – First party cookies are examples that are
 only used within one particular website. Data from the cookie isn't
 accessible to other websites.
 - Third party cookies – These cookies do contain data that third
 party websites can access. Examples include social media sharing
 controls or analytics based websites.

## Services that need cookies to work
