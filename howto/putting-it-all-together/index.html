        The end result of all the data munging, analysis, and data
        visualisation needs to be a compelling piece of work. Just
        doing a dashboard without supporting analysis and clear
        recommendations and calls for action won't bring about any
        results. Data doesn't speak for itself. You have to speak for
        it.

              on. You have to capture them right away with something
              that will make them stop and want to read the rest.

            <p class="lead">
              Maps are great if your data has a geographical component
              and are something you should always consider as people
              find them very compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              Time and again when I present users with a map the first
              thing they do is zoom directly to their own area. From
              there they usually check where they grew up or where
              other members of their family live. This is a great way
              to engage users and get them to dive into your data.

            <h4>Step Three - Give them the details</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              After you have their attention you need to allow them to
              drill into the details so that they can better
              understand the underlying relationships in the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              With our diabetes map there is a fair bit of variation,
              but without being able to drill into the details of the
              area you wouldn't know if the regional variation was
              because all of the surgeries in an area were the same or
              because of an enormous outlier in each CCG. Giving a
              detailed view of the underlying data helps with this.

              Repeatability, traceability and provenance are essential
              to what we do here as data analysts and
              communicators. We need to be able to show where we get
              our data from and how we've processed it.
            </p>

            <p>
              For public sites like this we can show what we've done
              in
              a <a href="https://github.com/CDECatapult/cdec.openhealthdata">github
              repository</a>. For internal work you might have other
              ways of publishing what you've done.
            </p>

            <p>
              People will make decisions that affect the world around
              you. Your work should be able to stand up to scrutiny.
