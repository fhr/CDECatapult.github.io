        The <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk">Health and Social Care
        Information Centre</a> has a tremendous collection of open
        data that allows us to track how our hospitals are doing, see
        how our GP Surgeries are performing and see how drugs are
        being prescribed across England.

            <h4>Tip One - Searching for Data at HSCIC</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              It all starts with the search. We'll highlight what we
              feel are some of the gems in the HSCIC data sets, but if
              you don't find what you are after here then you can see
              what you can find with
              HSCIC's <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/searchcatalogue">Search
              Catalogue</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can also engage with the people behind the Open Data
              at the Information Centre. They run a number of very
              responsive and friendly twitter
              accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/hscic">@HSCIC</a>
              and <a href="https://twitter.com/hscicopendata">@HSCICOpenData</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Often when I'm looking for the best data to answer my
              question a friendly tweet to them will point me to some
              data that I didn't know existed or data that is more up
              to date than the one I knew about.
            </p>

            <p>
              The twitter accounts are also great places to ask
              questions about the data sets you find and discuss
              potential problems or errors you might see in the data.

            <h4>Tip Two - Indicators Portal</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              The <a href="https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/index.jsp">
                Indicators Portal</a> is probably your next port of
                call as you are searching for data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here you'll find lots of Excel spreadsheets that can be
              turned into csv files that you can process with other
              tools. Most of the data isn't what you would call big,
              but there is a wide variety of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is data on Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs),
              GP Practices, Adult Social Care, Hospital Mortality and
              the NHS Outcomes Framework.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Indicators Portal is where we were able to find
              the <a href="http://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&submode=ddi&study=http%3A%2F%2Fhg-l-app-472.ic.green.net%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FP00974&mode=documentation&top=yes">Diabetes
              Prevalence</a> data that we used to create the maps on
              the <a href="http://openhealthdata.cdehub.org/">Open

            <h4>Tip Three - GP Practice Indicators</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              Hidden deep in the guts of the Indicator Portal is one
              of the best files for data analysis on the Indicators
              Portal. The <a href="http://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&catalog=http%3A%2F%2F172.16.9.26%3A80%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog48&submode=catalog&mode=documentation&top=yes">GP Practice Indicators</a>
              which can be found in a complete
              <a href="http://icdata.ic.nhs.uk/GPOutcomes.zip">.zip
              file</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you can see on the left each line has a practice code
              and name and which CCG that practice belongs to.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are also indicators on demography, infrastructure,
              patient experience and other patient care indicators. It
              feels a bit like Trip Advisor for GP Surgeries.

            <h4>Tip Five - Prescriptions Data</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              The <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata">Prescribing by GP Practice</a> data set is perhaps one of the best data exhaust sets at HSCIC.
            </p>

            <p>
              The data itself is produced by the NHS Business Services Authority and is used to pay GPs based on how many and what kind of drugs they've prescribed. We can use it with other information from things like the British National Formulary or NICE Guidelines to use it to get a rough estimate of the kinds of health issues in an area or see how prescriptions vary regionally. Combining this with the prevalence data in some of the indicators files can also give you an idea about how much is being spent per person who has a condition as well.

            <h4>Tip Five - Geographic Data</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              Finding geographic data can actually be quite
              tricky. Clinical Commissioning Groups are based on
              Census Regions like Output Areas and Super Output Areas,
              but finding a good source to use for mapping with
              something like <a href="/howto/spruce-leaf">Spruce
              Leaf</a> can be tough.
            </p>

            <p>
              We've solved some of that problem for you by having a
              Topojson
              file <a href="http://openhealthdata.cdehub.org/data/ccg-boundaries.json">here</a>. Remember though that the geographical information is based on Ordnance Survey data and their license requires that you cite them when you use it.
