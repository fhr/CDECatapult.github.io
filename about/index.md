It is intended to demonstrate the potential to innovate
with new sources and types of linked health data, to SME innovators in
the fields of data analysis, data visualization, service
design, web and app development. It is also
intended to demonstrate to public and private sector data
owners the economic and service enhancements possible through
opening and integrating data by using common standards.


### Methodology
This site takes data from sources like the [Health and
Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)](http://www.hscic.gov.uk)
and shows how it can be turned into visualisations and analysis
to answer specific questions for your organisation.
This is the BETA version of the site, which shows how
to take a small number of datasets including data about
GP prescriptions and diabetes prevalence to show the extent
of diabetes treatment in the UK.
